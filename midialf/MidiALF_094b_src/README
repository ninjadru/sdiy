v0.94b
	- miscellaneous fixes and optimizations

v0.94a
	- fixed screen update problem after sequence switch on end (thanks to Peter_Ullrich @ MI forums)
	- send CC1/2 CV if incoming CC matches CC1/2 controller number
	- added aftertouch CV mode
	- added pitch bend CV mode
	
v0.94
	- implemented synchronous sequence switching: immediate or on sequence end
	- fixed ghost gate signals when step length is longer than sequence grid (/CV)
	- single Encoder B click while on the top level page shows Note page
	- double Encoder B click while on the top level page shows Seq Settings page
	- streamlined device Control Change events handling
	- sequence transposition is now reset on start
	
v0.93d
	- fixed missing CV/Gate pulses (thanks to joshuagoran @ MI forum for testing)
	
v0.93c
	- fixed Seq pulse generation
	- implemented configurable strobe width (thanks to pichenettes @ MI forum for suggestion)
	- improved CV/Gate clock stability (thanks to joshuagoran @ MI forum for testing)

v0.93b
	- fixed problem with legato notes sounding only once when hold mode is in effect

v0.93a
	- allow note length longer than the sequence step length (thanks to shiftr @ MI forum)
	- rotate sequence commands now rotate linked (16 and 32 step) sequences as a whole
	- fixed problem with nonlinear progression sequence re-staring from where it was stopped
	  instead of the first step. Thanks to Jacob Karlstrom.
	
v0.93
	- implemented note CV tuning, see command page/Tune
	- implemented CV/Gate output support, compile with ENABLE_CV_OUTPUT define to enable it (see midialf/makefile)
	- improved LFO UI: shape set to "none" stops LFO on both CC and CV, CC set to 0 prevents LFO on CC only

v0.92a
	- rotating step encoder in step hold mode selects active step  

v0.92
	- added step hold mode toggled by SEL+CLK
	- implemented received CC ignore/receive setting
	- implemented root note setting learn mode
	- implemented CC1/CC2 number learn mode
	- implemented LFO1/2 CC number learn mode
